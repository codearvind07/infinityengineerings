# Performance Optimizations Implemented

## 1. ThreeDSphereSection Component Optimizations

### Particle System Optimizations
- Reduced particle count from 200 to 100 (50 on low-performance devices)
- Reduced flowing particles from 150 to 75 (35 on low-performance devices)
- Reduced background particles from 8 to 4 (2 on low-performance devices)
- Added `will-change: transform` to all animated elements
- Disabled animations on low-performance devices

### Mouse Movement Optimizations
- Implemented throttling for mouse movement updates
- Reduced update frequency on low-performance devices
- Used `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth updates
- Added early return for minimal mouse movements

### Rendering Optimizations
- Added `will-change: transform` to all animated elements
- Optimized sphere transformation with hardware acceleration
- Added performance checks for low-end devices
- Memoized all particle rendering with `useMemo`

## 2. Global CSS Optimizations

### Hardware Acceleration
- Added `transform: translateZ(0)` to all elements
- Added `will-change: transform` to animated elements
- Enabled `backface-visibility: hidden` and `perspective`
- Optimized background rendering with `background-attachment: fixed`

### Animation Optimizations
- Added support for `prefers-reduced-motion` media query
- Created low-performance mode that disables complex animations
- Optimized transition durations with CSS variables
- Simplified complex gradients on low-performance devices

### Scroll Optimizations
- Enabled smooth scrolling with `scroll-behavior: smooth`
- Added `-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch` for mobile devices
- Optimized font rendering with antialiasing

## 3. JavaScript Performance Utilities

### Device Detection
- Added `prefersReducedMotion()` function to detect user preferences
- Added `isLowPerformanceDevice()` function to detect device capabilities
- Implemented automatic performance adjustments based on device capabilities

### Event Listener Optimizations
- Added passive event listeners for scroll, touch, and wheel events
- Implemented throttling and debouncing for performance-critical functions
- Used `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth animations

### Lazy Loading
- Implemented Intersection Observer for image lazy loading
- Optimized observer with root margin and threshold settings

## 4. Next.js Configuration Optimizations

### Build Optimizations
- Enabled CSS optimization
- Enabled image optimization
- Enabled font optimization
- Enabled scroll restoration

### Compiler Optimizations
- Removed console logs in production (except errors)
- Modularized imports for better tree-shaking

### HTTP Headers
- ~~Added caching headers for static assets~~
- ~~Added security headers (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection)~~

**Note**: Custom headers are not supported with `output: 'export'` configuration. These headers would need to be configured at the server level or CDN level instead.

## 5. Accessibility Optimizations

### Reduced Motion Support
- Disabled animations for users who prefer reduced motion
- Respected user preferences for motion sensitivity

## 6. Performance Monitoring

### Development Tools
- Added console logging for performance optimizations in development
- Added device capability detection logging

## Results

These optimizations should significantly improve the scrolling performance and overall user experience by:

1. Reducing the computational load of animated elements
2. Enabling hardware acceleration for smoother animations
3. Implementing adaptive performance based on device capabilities
4. Optimizing event handling and rendering updates
5. Adding proper caching and compression
6. Respecting user preferences for accessibility

The ThreeDSphereSection component now automatically adapts to the user's device capabilities, providing a smooth experience on high-end devices while maintaining functionality on lower-end devices.
